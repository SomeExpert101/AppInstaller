Exploit made by TheTingGoesSkrrrPapa!

If you have any issues by getting kicked out of 
the game (which I will sort that out in the future),
you will have to delete roblox and redownload it!

I have put a RobloxPlayerLauncher in the folder so 
you don't have to go through roblox to download.

To delete roblox,
Press Windows key + r, type in the box "appdata",
when you typed that go to Local folder, and find
the roblox folder and delete it!
